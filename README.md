### `sync_here.sh`
This will try to find existing files in the filesystem which match the paths of files tracked here, and update the working copy in this git repo.
It's probably a good idea to make sure there are no changes in your working copy before running this, they will be lost.

### Misc

* The `.gitignore_global` is useful for things like system-wide things you'd never want to commit to git.  Editor metadata (vim backups, IntelliJ/Eclipse project info, etc.)
* The OpenVPN conf file should be generated using whtaever is recommended by your VPN provider.  You can store a username/password in a text file and reference it with `auth-user-pass /path-to-file/credentials.txt`
